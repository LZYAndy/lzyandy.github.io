## 👋🏻 About Me
I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student and Research Assistant at the National University of Singapore under the guidance of Professor [Dong Jin Song](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/). I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the National University of Singapore. My research is centered on [Sports Analytics](https://nus-sports-analytics.github.io/), a multi-disciplinary research field, where I employ Probabilistic Reasoning, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning for in-depth sports strategy analysis. My work focuses on developing Markov Decision Process (MDP) models for tennis strategy analysis, aiding professional players in pre-match analysis with remarkable success against top competitors. Additionally, my work involves using advanced video analytics to automatically extract and understand fast, frequent, and fine-grained event sequences from sports videos, providing intricate match insights. My analytical methodologies have been applied across multiple sports, including tennis (singles and doubles), badminton, basketball, American football, etc.
